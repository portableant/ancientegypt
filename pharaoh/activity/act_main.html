<b>The Challenge - 'Ask the experts'</b>
<p>
You are a young assistant in the Egyptology department of a museum. Last week you went around the museum talking to three different experts about four objects from the museum's collection. Each expert told you something about each of the objects.
<p>
The <b>conservator</b> told you what the objects were made of and how to take care of them.
<p>
The <b>curator</b> told you the history of the objects.
<p>
The <b>archaeologist</b> told you about when and where the objects were found.
<p>
You carefully wrote everything that the experts told you on separate cards. However, you forgot to write down the names of the objects on these cards. You have one card from each of the experts about each of the four objects. Read over the twelve cards and match each card with one of the four objects.
