The ancient Egyptians believed that before a person could get to the afterlife, that they had to pass through the underworld.  The underworld was a place that was full of terrifying monsters and dangerous animals. A person would need magic to successfully overcome these threats.
</p><p>
The ancient Egyptians chose spells to take with them on their journey. The spells were chosen from a group of spells known as the Book of the Dead. The spells were then written on a papyrus scroll which was buried with them in their tombs.
